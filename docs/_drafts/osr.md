## Objectif

A lot of the OSR is about trying to re-create that first feeling of adventuring:

    The world is strange.
    There’s much to be discovered.
    Your decisions matter.
    Magic is magical.
    Monsters are monstrous.


## Les 4 grands principes

From Matt's Primer :

Rulings, not rules: The referee, in turn, uses common sense to decide what happens or rolls a die if he thinks there’s some random element involved, and then the game moves on.

Player skill, not character abilities: You don’t have a “spot” check to let you notice hidden traps and levers, you don’t have a “bluff” check to let you automatically fool a suspicious city guardsman, and you don’t have a “sense motive” check to tell you when someone’s lying to your character. You have to tell the referee where you’re looking for traps and what buttons you’re pushing. You have to tell the referee whatever tall tale you’re trying to get the city guardsman to believe.

Heroic, not superheroes: Old-style games have a human-sized scale, not a super-powered scale. At first level, adventurers are barely more capable than a regular person. They live by their wits. But back to the Zen moment. Even as characters rise to the heights of power, they aren’t picking up super-abilities or high ability scores.

Forget "game balance": The old-style campaign is with fantasy world, with all its perils, contradictions, and surprises: it’s not a “game setting” which somehow always produces challenges of just the right difficulty for the party’s level of experience.
