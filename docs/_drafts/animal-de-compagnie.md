Good guide : Stibble Codex of Companions




The four RAW methods for player characters to have a pet would be 
1. through a class feature such as beast master ranger
2. through the spell find familiar
3. through another spell such as animal friendship or summon beasts
4. through the TCoE sidekick rules.


Alternatively, your DM may allow you to simply have/purchase a pet or ask for an animal handling check to befriend an animal.

The spell Speak With Animals allows characters to talk to animals, form a bond, and make them part of the group. Animal Handling could tame a creature, and take them on as a pet. The group could stumble upon a dragon egg and hatch it, then the dragon whelp mistakes the first character it sees as its parent, and forms a bond. A queen in the Fey Wilds might be impressed with the group of adventurers, and bestows upon them a Blink Dog pup as a reward.

This is entirely up to the DM and the players — and for everyone to talk about, to make sure they agree, and don’t unbalance the game. There is a lot of flexibility. That’s the great thing about it being pencil and paper — or text and screen. The rules are guidelines, but can be bent and changed to create what is fun for everyone. And what’s more fun than pets?


    Will the player be able to command the companion?
    Is the companion more a pet, not participating in combat?
    Do they display certain traits? What are those?

 
Does the player(s) have to roll Animal Handling to try to give commands?
Will the animal fight with the party or flee?
Does the companion start to trust the party and eventually listen to 

One way is to make this a working relationship. There can be a time when the animal is "on duty" and "off duty" where they are focused on whatever the day's goals are until their armor is removed for the night and the animal knows they can be more playful. Or maybe they are more serious all the time.

## Stat Blocks

Use an animal's stat block to guide you in how the animal companion will behave. If the animal has a low intelligence modifier, they won't make the best decisions.

They can keep fighting even if they are surrounded or in danger. They can forget that certain types of enemies resist the damage the animal companion deals.

High-intelligence animals can make more tactical decisions. They would know when to flee or where they would be safe. They can learn how to weaken an enemy or give your players advantage.

## Loyalty

Loyalty is an optional rule in D&D, but it's just a concept as well. Just like with NPCs, you can use loyalty to determine how an animal companion will interact with the party.
DMG : You can track loyalty with numbers, as the optional rule stats. Each time the party or player does something that helps the companion or makes them happy, you can give them a loyalty point.

## Personality

Much like with NPCs, you can give the animal companion different quirks or traits to make them feel more real.

Is the animal companion fascinated by shiny things? You can make them distracted when they see something that catches their eye. Do they hate water? They can refuse to enter water, even if commanded to in combat.

## Combat

For knowing a character beforehand, you can make it so that the player doesn't even have to issue commands. They know each other so well that the animal companion picks up on what their ally is doing and follows suit.

For joining the party afterward, the animal companion can prioritize themselves or their safety. They may even find situations they decide not to fight in, not knowing what side is best.

If they are the companion of a Beast Master, they can be methodical or very dutiful. Unlike a loyal companion that may break from a command to provide aid, they can stay on task even when their ally is in grave danger.

With stat blocks, you can see what the animal's strengths are and have them use those attacks or actions. You can also have their different stats tell you if they would fight smarter or fight harder.

For loyalty, if they feel a great deal of loyalty to the player or the party, they can defend them fiercely. If they are lacking trust and loyalty, then they can ignore commands and flee.

For quirks and traits, you can make them stop and play with shiny things. Or they can refuse to follow certain commands altogether.

## Abilities

The animal companion can find items that the players either wouldn't or missed. They can walk away and dig up something to bring back.

They can also give players advantage with perception and investigation checks.

If the players are sleeping in shifts to avoid being surprised on the road, the animal companion can take one of the shifts, either giving players some time to focus on other things or rest longer.




## Level up

Level up companion with the party : You can give the animal companion increased stats or health when the party levels up.

## Concerns



Pets are handled erratically:

    You can easily find stats for a pet among the various bestiaries and internet. That isn't difficult.

    You can have some cute role-play encounters with them.

    You include them in battle once or twice until you realize that it is more work for the DM and a pet takes away from the players playing the game (delays their turn and slows down battle for very little advantages.) ... so they are quickly dropped from initiative.

    Very easily killed by area of effects attacks, traps or hazards. Really anything dishing out 20 damage to everyone in the room will take care of all the pets.

    Once one is in the group others want some so they multiply like tribbles.

    Spend most of the time shoved into a bag and forgotten.
