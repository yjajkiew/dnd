# Introduire un nouveau personnage
{: .no_toc }

Que ce soit parce qu'un personnage est mort que votre joueur doit en créer un nouveau, ou que ce soit tout simplement pour introduire un nouveau personnage temporaire car vous accueillez un joueur invité temporairement dans une campagne, il est toujours intéressant de mettre en place des astuces narratives pour introduire un personnage dans la bande.

## Quel moment ?

#1 – If the group is in-between adventures in town, I have the new character arrive before the rest of the characters, and then I turn to the player and ask them, “Could you explain why you are here and why you want to join the group?”

#2 – If the group is in the middle of an adventure, I have the new character arrive before the rest of the characters, and then I turn to the player and ask them, “Could you explain why you are here and why you want to join the group?”

Why is that new character there in that moment? Why do they want to join the existing adventuring party? Why are they motivated to help the party with their current goals?


### Directement dans l'action
Usually within 5 minutes we can get them plugged in so they can enjoy the game along with everyone else.

When you’re introducing a character in medias res, you’re introducing them at the next logical step in the very session their player has them ready. This means you’ll have to work some magic to insert them into the story in a sound way. Work with the player to make this happen. Overall, this is the best way to introduce a new character. It keeps the story intact, lets the new player or the old player’s new character quickly join in on the action again, and only requires a bit of coordination and suspension of disbelief from the rest of the group.

### En temps voulu

If you’re willing to wait for the perfect moment to introduce a new party member, you’re following the “at the proper time” approach. Sadly, it might take longer to let a new member join this way, but it might be the right method if your group is super into immersive gameplay. In my view, this is the worst way to introduce a new member, especially if it’s a completely new player. Get people into the game, don’t stall and respect the story, giving it precedence over the fun of the new player unless you see it as a necessary evil.

 is the PERFECT character introduction at the PERFECT moment really worth it if a player’s personal game experience suffers because of it?
 

### Le plus rapidement possible

is the PERFECT character introduction at the PERFECT moment really worth it if a player’s personal game experience suffers because of it?

Some folks don’t care about immersion or story sensibility and love the “as fast as possible” tactic. This means as soon as the session starts, the party gains a new member no matter the circumstance the group is in. I’ve seen groups where the new member simply fades into the group, teleports in via an extra dimensional portal, or just charges into the session-starting battle. It works, just not for all groups. Some people don’t care how their new friend joins in, they just want them there; they’re able to conjure up how and why they’re there on the spot.

I have found that it’s better to lean into the absurd a little bit. 



## Quelle explication narrative ?

### Envoi par une guilde

Someone you know is in need of assistance or a favor. For low level characters it could be a relative, like a distant cousin or long forgotten uncle, or even a here-to-fore unknown half-sibling, or possibly a childhood friend or former love (see also; #2). For higher level characters perhaps your reputation is becoming renowned. Did you not know the Bards sing of you? The Duke, the GuildMaster, or even the King therefore requests your aid in an urgent matter. it should be noted that many of these hooks or adventure starts involve the PCs being verbally summoned (their presence is requested) by someone; whether King, or relation, or old friend, or Guild, or patron deity

### Une rencontre fortuite

At any town, the party goes to a tavern, the new PC is in said tavern, they share stories and by the end of the night they decide to join up. 

### Un vieil ami

The new PC is a childhood friend of an existing PC. They contact the existing PC for help with something. Maybe they’ve found a map hidden in the binding of an old book, or bought a locket from a traveling merchant and discovered something special. 

### Le recrutement

we'd like to hold a job interview in character because we felt like we needed a 4th person.
The DM then created a bunch of junk options that were there to be comedically bad so the only sensible choice was to hire the new player. 

### Le NPC devient PNJ
 Presumably you're pretty familiar with the NPC who comes to the party with their problem. Or the party runs into them. Whatever. Make the player that NPC.
