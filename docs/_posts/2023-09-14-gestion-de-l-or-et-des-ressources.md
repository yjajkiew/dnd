How Much Gold is Considered Rich in DND?

The Players Handbook provides us with some guidance on what qualifies as “rich” when it comes to accumulating gold in DND. Under the rules, a modest lifestyle – which is better than most of the NPCs you will encounter live – costs 1 gold per day. A wealthy lifestyle increases to 4 gold per day, which means your character would need at least 1460 gold per year to life in the lap of luxury. Based on this, most adventurers would be considered rich in DND. That makes sense when you are risking your life battling dragons and such!
